# MVVM_App
Android MVVM Architecture app: sample android project on how to use the Model View ViewModel(MVVM) architecture with retrofit and fake API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for network requests.  The network request returns a list of users which is displayed in a RecyclerView. The MVVM architecture enables developers to write maintainable code and achieve separation of concerns.
